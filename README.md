**Chat with Your Notes – PDF Q&amp;A Chatbot (Generative AI &amp; RAG)**
Developed an intelligent PDF-based Question & Answer chatbot using Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
The system allows users to upload PDF documents and ask contextual questions, generating accurate answers using Gemini 1.5 Flash, LangChain, and FAISS. 
Implemented PDF text extraction with PyMuPDF, vector-based retrieval for relevant content, and a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. 
The project demonstrates efficient document understanding, semantic search, and conversational AI with chat history support.
